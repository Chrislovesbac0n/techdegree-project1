        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am a self taught web designer learning to love my work and continuing to grow with each new project and challenging myself to do and not to try.</p>
        <p>I started my working career as a busser in a small restaurant in my home town of Carson, CA and moved on to other eventually working myself up to a Manager role for the best restaurant owners, who I still consider my friends to this day. Unfortunately I knew the restaurant business was not for me and moved on to
        the supply chain side of a small company you might know of as Samsung. Here I would learn to analyze data for our procurement team, learning how to solve problems with just the data and communicate with the team on how we can improve on a number of KPIs.
        I eventually got promoted to the procurement team as a procurement specialist for the VD (Visual Display) side of things. This role was much more time consumming and demanding, while being wholistcally unfullfilling as it was just figuring out how to save money and have the best performance possible.
        I aspired to be something more. So I started thinking about a new career and technology was something I have always been interested in and quite good at. So here I am, learning to be a web developer and start my dream of moving to New York.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to master the process of building web sites and increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>React</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I would ultimately love to create and design websites for myself as well as helping others realize
           their creative dreams and aspirations.</p>
        <p>Creating websites for myself would allow me to showcase my abilities to other people and companies who I can help and bring joy to. </p>
        <p>I have a dream of living in multiple cites across the world and visiting many countries, exploring their people, culture and food. Becoming a web developer would assist me in completing that dream
           since it would allow me to work remotely from anywhere being able so solve problems and use my creative skills from anywhere in the world.</p>
        <p>Oh, and one more thing. "I got dreams, baby. And you're in 'em."</p>
